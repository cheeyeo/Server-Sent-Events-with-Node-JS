Server Sent Events
=============================

Introduction
---------------

Server Sent Events (SSEs) is a form of uni directional communication mechanism where servers
can send data to clients using ordinary HTTP protocols unlike Websockets which are bi-directional and requires specific servers to run.

The examples provided here are implemented using Node JS for the server and plain JS for the HTML file.

The example only works in Chrome and Safari.

More information about SSEs can be found at http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/eventsource/basics/

The code in this tutorial are extracted from the demo links at the bottom of the page.

Running the examples
---------------------

Assuming you have node installed:

node server.js

inside browser: localhost:8000/sse-node.html
